## 1. Explore the repository:

We forked the repository for this project into our own Git repository so we could use it for this activity: <https://github.com/data-curation/PISA>

![forked repository](/cdcf-workshop2B/assets/fork.png)

## 2. Find the following files in the PISA repository:
  	
- `requirements.txt`
- `runtime.txt`
- `pisa_project_part1.ipynb`

Match the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` with those listed in the `pisa_project_part1.ipynb` notebook. What is different? 

Bonus: can you find where the information in the `runtime.txt` file is found in the notebook? *Don't read all of the code, it's much simpler than that.*

## 3. In the Git directory, find the location of the following `.csv` files and match them to where they are named in the Jupyter notebook. 

*Hint: it's in the second code cell.*
- `pisa_math_2003_2015.csv`
- `pisa_read_2000_2015.csv`
- `pisa_science_2006_2015.csv`

Bonus: are the filenames relative?
